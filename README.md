In this dynamically updating world, Web development is changing it's behaviour.
First we used some amount of javascript to validate a form field to full validation of individual form 
element.
But today we are here to talk about something else "SERVERLESS"
Don't get confused with it's name serverless actually does not mean that there are no server's
There are servers and in this post i will show you what all these means
Consider you buy a linux hosting to host your website and your website is making very less traffic
let us say 100 to 200 page views in a month and in a month almost 20 days its having no views
and no views means no web request and no web request means your server is sitting idol. But still you pay 
bills for you hosting. 
Can't be there some solution like pay bills on the amount of server resource you use?
If your website is making few request pay a few dollars and you are done
Okay let me ask you a second question 
What if your website started growing fast
You need to buy more resources configure them
again if your website grows you need to buy more resources and configure
What if i told you that there is a solution to all these problem
----------"SERVERLESS"--------------------
severless is the solution to your problem
